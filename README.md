# [ProducitivtyVis](https://productivityvis.com "productvityvis.com")
A visualization that helps people mantain their focus by tracking focus intervals. If someone makes it through the interval, a sucessful interval is counted, if they become off task they can hit reset and the interval is highlighted as incomplete. By allowing focusers to reflect on what caused the distraction and label it via a drop down menu people can learn their habits and optimize their behavior for better focus.

Built to explore the relationship between React and D3.js
