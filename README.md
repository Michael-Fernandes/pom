A visualization that helps people maintain their focus by tracking focus intervals. If someone makes it through the interval, a successful interval is counted, if they become off task they can hit reset and the interval is highlighted as incomplete. By allowing focusers to reflect on what caused the distraction and label it via a drop-down menu people can learn their habits and optimize their behavior for better focus.

## Background
This app was built to explore the relationship between React and D3.js. D3.js a Charting Library is not built with react in mind, I built this app as an introduction in how to make [D3 work in React land](https://medium.com/@tibotiber/react-d3-js-balancing-performance-developer-experience-4da35f912484 "Article").

The overall idea is inspired by the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique "Wikipedia Article")
